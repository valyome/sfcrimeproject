# sfcrimeproject
This is for a school final project

We gather the data about San Francisco crimes and we will analyse them through machine learning

The whole data gathered was not all confined in SF, so we need to cut some data out. 

This is the data visualization after filtering irrelavant data:

In order to use machine learning. We split the SF into 9 regions.

Here is how it looks:

Furthermore, we can split for data from every category.
