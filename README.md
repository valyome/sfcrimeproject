# sfcrimeproject
This is for a school final project

We gather the data about San Francisco crimes and we will analyse them through machine learning

The whole data gathered was not all confined in SF, so we need to cut some data out. 

This is the data visualization after filtering irrelavant data:

but notice that the right upper corner has some data, but they are out of SF technically, so I further cut out that part. 

Here is the cleaned data
